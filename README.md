# Mindset Logos

The one place at Mindset for every customer logo. 119 companies, both `on-light` and `on-dark` variants, hand-verified and transparent. Use it from the browser, from Claude Code, from the API, or clone the repo and use the files directly.

## Where to find it

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| **Gallery** | [mindset-logos.vercel.app](https://mindset-logos.vercel.app) |
| **GitHub** | [MindsetConsulting/mindset-logos](https://github.com/MindsetConsulting/mindset-logos) |
| **Vercel** | [vercel.com/mindsetconsulting/mindset-logos](https://vercel.com/mindsetconsulting/mindset-logos) |
| **JSON API** | `https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/api/logos` |
| **MCP server** | `claude mcp add mindset-logos -- bunx @mindsetconsulting/mindset-logos-mcp` |
| **Raw files** | `https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/logos/{slug}-on-{light,dark}.{ext}` |

## How to use it

### In a browser

Open the gallery. Search, filter by vertical, copy any logo's URL or download the file.

### In Claude Code via MCP

```bash
claude mcp add mindset-logos -- bunx @mindsetconsulting/mindset-logos-mcp
```

Then in any Claude Code session, ask things like:

- "Grab the on-dark version of 3M and put it in the hero"
- "List our customers in the food & beverage vertical"
- "Build a customer-logo wall for all 119 of our customers"

The server exposes three tools: `list_logos`, `get_logo(slug, variant)`, and `search_logos(query)`.

### From a script (JSON API)

```bash
curl https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/api/logos
```

Returns every customer with their `onLight` and `onDark` file paths, website, industry, and verticals.

### Direct file URLs

Every file is served at `https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/logos/{slug}-on-{variant}.{ext}`. Example:

```
https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/logos/3m-on-dark.png
https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/logos/agiliti-on-light.webp
https://mindset-logos.vercel.app/logos/bcbs-mn-on-light.svg
```

Use them in Markdown, Slack, decks, emails, anywhere.

## Adding a new customer

1. Add an entry to `public/logos/manifest.json` with `slug`, `name`, `website`, `industry`, `verticals`.
2. `bun run fetch <slug>` — pulls both variants from Brandfetch with a fallback to vendor website scraping.
3. `bun run audit` — check quality and variant classification.
4. If the automatic fetch produced flat/icon/tiny variants, follow the techniques in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) to re-source from the vendor site (logovectorseek, seeklogo, Wikipedia, or the header of the homepage). There are three documented techniques (trust existing alpha, Pillow pixel swap, SVG color swap) that cover every logo we've hit.
5. Add the slug to `.pending-approval.json` until visually verified, then remove it.
6. Commit and push. Vercel redeploys automatically.

## Fixing a bad logo

See the three techniques in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). The gist:
- **Trust existing alpha** — Brandfetch files are often already transparent; just trim and save, never `-alpha off`.
- **Pillow pixel swap** — for raster logos with visible theme colors, walk pixels with a per-channel rule (`b > r + 25`, `max(r,g,b) < 80`, etc) and preserve the original alpha.
- **SVG color swap** — for vendor SVGs with white-text/colored-emblem mixes, use a Python regex keyed on the path's starting M x-coordinate so you only swap text-region white fills.

## Architecture

- `app/` — Next.js 16 gallery UI (Playfair Display + Inter + JetBrains Mono, Mindset brand theme).
- `public/logos/` — all logo files, the `manifest.json`, `audit.json`, pending/override lists.
- `lib/logos.ts` — reads the manifest and resolves each slug's variant file paths.
- `scripts/` — `fetch-logos.ts`, `audit.ts`, `fix.ts`, `apply-approvals.ts`. Run with `bun run {fetch,audit,fix,apply-approvals}`.
- `mcp/` — stdio MCP server that wraps the JSON API.
- `CLAUDE.md` — full technique reference, baked into the repo so any Claude Code session has the context.

Deployed to Vercel from `main`. The GitHub Actions pipeline rebuilds the `@mindsetconsulting/brand` asset on brand updates.
